# Julios

## General
This project contains the code deployed to https://www.julioscapemay.com/ for a restaurant.

It was my first Vue/Nuxt project using Typescript. Instead of creating WordPress or similar site, I wanted to learn a new framework for creating simple static websites.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
